      "# Section 1. Neoplastic Disorders\n## 69. Approach to the Patient with Cancer - Dan L. Longo\n### THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM\nNo nationwide cancer registry exists; therefore, the incidence of cancer is estimated on the basis of the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, which tabulates cancer incidence and death figures from 13 sites, accounting for about 10% of the U.S. population, and from population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2021, 1.898 million new cases of invasive cancer (970,250 men and 927,910 women) were diagnosed, and 608,570 persons (319,420 men and 289,150 women) died from cancer. The percent distribution of new cancer cases and cancer deaths by site for men and women is shown in Table 69-1. Cancer incidence has been declining by about 2% each year since 1992. Cancer is the cause of one in five deaths in the United States.\n\nThe most significant risk factor for cancer overall is age; two-thirds of all cases were in those aged >65 years. Cancer incidence increases as the third, fourth, or fifth power of age in different sites.",

Reproduced with permission of John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nBetween birth and age 49 years, 1 in 29 men and 1 in 19 women will develop cancer; for the interval between ages 50 and 59 years, 1 in 15 men and 1 in 17 women will develop cancer; for the interval between ages 60 and 69 years, 1 in 6 men and 1 in 10 women will develop cancer; and for people aged ≥70, 1 in 3 men and 1 in 4 women will develop cancer. Overall, men have a 40.5% risk of developing cancer at some time during their lives; women have a 38.9% lifetime risk.\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death behind heart disease. Deaths from heart disease have declined 45% in the United States since 1950 and continue to decline. Cancer has overtaken heart disease as the number one cause of death in persons aged ≥85 years. Incidence trends over time are shown in **Fig. 69-1**. After a 70-year period of increase, cancer death rates began to decline in 1990–1991 (**Fig. 69-2**). Between 1990 and 2010, cancer deaths decreased by 21% among men and 12.3% among women. The incidence has been steady since 2013. The magnitude of the decline is illustrated in **Fig. 69-3**. The five leading causes of cancer deaths are shown for various populations in **Table 69-2**. The 5-year survival for white patients was 39% in 1960–1963 and 68% in 2010–2016. Cancers are more often deadly in blacks; the 5-year survival was 63% for the 2010–2016 interval; however, the racial differences are narrowing over time. Incidence and mortality vary among racial and ethnic groups (**Table 69-3**). The basis for these differences is unclear.\n\nAdvances in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment since the early 1990s have averted millions of cancer deaths based on projections from the slopes of the mortality curves leading up to the 1990s (**Fig. 69-4**).\n\n#### CANCER AROUND THE WORLD\n\nIn 2018, 17 million new cancer cases and 9.5 million cancer deaths were estimated worldwide, according to estimates of GLOBOCAN 2018, developed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Rates are increasing worldwide. When broken down by region of the world, ~45% of cases were in Asia (which has 59.5% of the world’s population), 26% in Europe (9.8% of the world’s population), 14.5% in North America, 7.1% in Central/South America (the Americas, North and South, account for 13.3% of the world’s population), 5.8% in Africa (16.9% of the world’s population), and 1% in Australia/New Zealand (0.5% of the world’s population) (**Fig. 69-5**). Lung cancer is the most common cancer and the most common cause of cancer death in the world. Its incidence is highly variable, affecting only 2 per 100,000 African women but as many as 61 per 100,000 North American men.\n\nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide; however, it ranks fourth as a cause of death behind lung, stomach, and liver cancer. Among the eight most common forms of cancer, lung (2-fold), breast (3-fold), prostate (2.5-fold), and colorectal (3-fold) cancers are more common in more developed countries than in less developed countries. By contrast, liver (2-fold), cervical (2-fold), and esophageal (2- to 3-fold) cancers are more common in less developed countries. Stomach cancer incidence is similar in more and less developed countries but is much more common in Asia than North America or Africa. The most common cancers in Africa are cervical, breast, and liver cancers. It has been estimated that nine modifiable risk factors are responsible for more than one-third of cancers worldwide. These include smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, physical inactivity, low fruit and vegetable consumption, unsafe sex, air pollution, indoor smoke from household fuels, and contaminated infections.",
      "# Section 1. Neoplastic Disorders\n## 69. Approach to the Patient with Cancer - Dan L. Longo\n### PATIENT MANAGEMENT\nImportant information is obtained from every portion of the routine history and physical examination. The duration of symptoms may reveal the chronicity of disease. The past medical history may alert the physician to the presence of underlying diseases that may affect the choice of therapy or the side effects of treatment. The social history may reveal occupational exposure to carcinogens or habits, such as smoking or alcohol consumption, that may influence the course of disease and its treatment. The family history may suggest an underlying familial cancer predisposition and point out the need to begin surveillance or other preventive therapy for unaffected siblings of the patient. The review of systems may suggest early symptoms of metastatic disease or a paraneoplastic syndrome.\n\n#### DIAGNOSIS\n\nThe diagnosis of cancer relies most heavily on invasive tissue biopsy and should never be made without obtaining tissue; no noninvasive diagnostic test is used to define a disease process such as cancer. Although in rare clinical settings (e.g., thyroid nodules), fine-needle aspiration is an acceptable diagnostic procedure, the diagnosis generally depends on obtaining adequate tissue to permit careful evaluation of the histology of the tumor, its grade, and its invasiveness and to yield further molecular diagnostic information, such as the expression of cell-surface markers or intracellular proteins that typify a particular cancer, or the presence of a molecular marker, such as the t(8;14) translocation of Burkitt’s lymphoma. Increasing evidence links the expression of certain genes with the prognosis and response to therapy (**Chaps. 71 and 72**).\n\nOccasionally, a patient will present with a metastatic disease process that is defined as cancer on biopsy but has no apparent primary site of disease. Efforts should be made to define the primary site based on age, sex, sites of involvement, histology and tumor markers, and personal and family history. Particular attention should be focused on ruling out the most treatable causes (**Chap. 92**).",
      "# Section 1. Neoplastic Disorders\n## 69. Approach to the Patient with Cancer - Dan L. Longo\n### DEFINING THE EXTENT OF DISEASE AND THE PROGNOSIS\nThe first priority in patient management after the diagnosis of cancer is established and shared with the patient is to determine the extent of disease. The curability of a tumor usually is inversely proportional to the tumor burden. Ideally, the tumor will be diagnosed before symptoms develop or as a consequence of screening efforts (**Chap. 70**). A very high proportion of such patients can be cured. However, most patients with cancer present with symptoms related to the cancer, caused either by mass effects of the tumor or by alterations associated with the production of cytokines or hormones by the tumor.\n\nFor most cancers, the extent of disease is evaluated by a variety of noninvasive and invasive diagnostic tests and procedures. This process is called **staging**. There are two types. **Clinical staging** is based on physical examination, radiographs, isotopic scans, computed tomography (CT) scans, and other imaging procedures; **pathologic staging** takes into account information obtained during a surgical procedure, which might include intraoperative palpation, resection of regional lymph nodes and/or tissue adjacent to the tumor, and inspection and biopsy of organs commonly involved in disease spread. Pathologic staging includes histologic examination of all tissues removed during the surgical procedure. Surgical procedures performed may include a simple lymph node biopsy or more extensive procedures such as thoracotomy, mediastinoscopy, or laparotomy. Surgical staging may occur in a separate procedure or may be done at the time of definitive surgical resection of the primary tumor. A subset of pathologic staging is the examination of tissue obtained at initial surgery that occurs after the delivery of some treatment, which is called **neoadjuvant therapy**. Stage of disease is determined after neoadjuvant therapy is designated with the prefix **y**.\n\nKnowledge of the predicted site of particular tumors for spreading to adjacent or distant organs helps direct the staging evaluation.\n\nInformation obtained from staging is used to define the extent of disease as localized, as exhibiting spread outside of the organ of origin to regional but not distant sites, or as metastatic to distant sites. The most widely used system of staging is the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system codified by the International Union Against Cancer and the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The TNM classification is an anatomically based system that categorizes the tumor on the basis of the size of the primary tumor lesion (T1–4, where a higher number indicates a larger tumor size), the presence of nodal involvement (usually N0 and N1 for the absence and presence, respectively, of involved nodes, although some tumors have more elaborate systems of nodal grading), and the presence of metastatic disease (M0 and M1 for the absence and presence, respectively, of metastases). The various permutations of T, N, and M scores (sometimes including tumor histologic grade [G]) are then broken into stages, usually designated by the Roman numerals I through IV. Tumor burden increases and curability decreases with increasing stage. Other anatomic staging systems are used for some tumors, e.g., the Dukes classification for colorectal cancers, the International Federation of Gynecologists and\nObstetricians classification for gynecologic cancers, and the Ann Arbor\nclassification for Hodgkin’s disease.",

For example, hematopoietic tumors such as leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma are often disseminated at presentation and do not spread like solid tumors. For these tumors, other prognostic factors have been identified (**Chaps. 104–111**).\n\nIn addition to tumor burden, a second major determinant of treatment outcome is the physiologic reserve of the patient. Patients who are bedridden before developing cancer are likely to fare worse, stage for stage, than fully active patients. Physiologic reserve is a determinant of how a patient is likely to cope with the physiologic stresses imposed by the cancer and its treatment. This factor is difficult to assess directly. Instead, surrogate markers for physiologic reserve are used, such as the patient’s age or Karnofsky performance status (**Table 69-4**) or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (**Table 69-5**). Older patients and those with a Karnofsky performance status <70 or ECOG performance status ≥3 have a poor prognosis unless the poor performance is a reversible consequence of the tumor.\n\nIncreasingly, biologic features of the tumor are being related to prognosis. The expression of particular oncogenes, drug-resistance genes, apoptosis-related genes, and genes involved in metastasis is being found to influence response to therapy and prognosis. The presence of selected cytogenetic abnormalities may influence survival. Tumors with higher growth fractions, such as those with deregulation of proliferation-related markers such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, behave more aggressively than tumors with lower growth fractions. Information obtained from studying the tumor itself will increasingly be used to influence treatment decisions. Host genes involved in drug metabolism can influence the safety and efficacy of particular treatments.\n\nEnormous heterogeneity has been noted by studying tumors; we have learned that morphology is not capable of discerning certain distinct subsets of patients whose tumors have different sets of abnormalities. Tumors that look the same by light microscopy can be very different. Similarly, tumors that look quite different from one another histologically can share genetic lesions that predict response to treatments. Furthermore, tumor cells vary enormously within a single patient even though the cells share a common origin.",
      "# Section 1. Neoplastic Disorders\n## 69. Approach to the Patient with Cancer - Dan L. Longo\n### MAKING A TREATMENT PLAN\nFrom information on the extent of disease and the prognosis and in conjunction with the patient’s wishes, it is determined whether the treatment approach should be curative or palliative in intent. Cooperation among the various professionals involved in cancer treatment is of the utmost importance in treatment planning. For some cancers, chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy delivered before the use of definitive surgical treatment (so-called neoadjuvant therapy) may improve the outcome, as seems to be the case for locally advanced breast cancer and head and neck cancers. In certain settings in which combined-modality therapy is intended, coordination among the medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and surgeon is crucial to achieving optimal results. Sometimes the chemotherapy and radiation therapy need to be delivered sequentially, and other times concurrently. Surgical procedures may precede or follow other treatment approaches. It is best for the treatment plan either to follow a standard protocol precisely or else to be part of an ongoing clinical research protocol evaluating new treatments. Ad hoc modifications of standard protocols are likely to compromise treatment results.\n\nThe choice of treatment approaches was formerly dominated by the local culture in both the university and the practice settings. However, it is now possible to gain access electronically to standard treatment protocols and to every approved clinical research study in North America through a personal computer interface with the Internet.†\n\n†The National Cancer Institute maintains a database called PDQ (Physician Data Query) that is accessible on the Internet under the name CancerNet at https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq. Information can be obtained through a facsimile machine using CancerFax by dialing 301-402-5874. Patient information is also provided by the National Cancer Institute in at least three formats: on the Internet via CancerNet at www.cancer.gov, through the CancerFax number listed above, or by calling 1-800-4-CANCER. The quality control for the information provided through these services is rigorous.\n\n#### SUPPORTIVE CARE\n\nIn many ways, the success of cancer therapy depends on the success of supportive care. Failure to control the symptoms of cancer and its treatment may lead patients to abandon curative therapy. Of equal importance, supportive care is a major determinant of quality of life. Even when life cannot be prolonged, the physician must strive to preserve its quality. Quality-of-life measurements have become common endpoints of clinical research studies. Furthermore, palliative care has been shown to be cost-effective when approached in an organized fashion. A credo for oncology could be to cure sometimes, to extend life often, and to comfort always.\n\n##### Pain\n\nPain occurs with variable frequency in the cancer patient: 25–50% of patients present with pain at diagnosis, 33% have pain associated with treatment, and 75% have pain with progressive disease. The pain may have several causes. In ~70% of cases, pain is caused by the tumor itself—by invasion of bone, nerves, blood vessels or mucous membranes or obstruction of a hollow viscus or duct. In ~20% of cases, pain is related to a surgical or invasive medical procedure, to radiation injury (mucositis, enteritis, or plexus, or spinal cord injury), or to chemotherapy injury (mucositis, peripheral neuropathy, phlebitis).\n\nAssessment of pain requires the methodical investigation of the intensity of the pain, its location, character, temporal features, provocative and palliative factors, and intensity (**Chaps. 12 and 13**); a review of the oncologic history and past medical history as well as personal and social history; and a thorough physical examination. The patient should be given a 10-division visual analogue scale on which to indicate the severity of the pain. The clinical condition is often dynamic, making it necessary to reassess the patient frequently. Pain therapy should not be withheld while the cause of pain is being sought.\n\nA variety of tools are available with which to address cancer pain. About 85% of patients will have pain relief from pharmacologic intervention. However, other modalities, including antitumor therapy (such as surgical relief of obstruction, radiation therapy, and strontium-89 or samarium-153 treatment for bone pain), neurostimulatory techniques, regional analgesia, or neuroablative procedures, are effective in an additional 12% or so. Thus, very few patients will have inadequate pain relief if appropriate measures are taken. A specific approach to pain relief is detailed in **Chap. 12**.\n\n##### Nausea\n\nNausea in the cancer patient is usually caused by chemotherapy (**Chap. 73**). Its severity can be predicted from the drugs used to treat the cancer. Three forms of emesis are recognized on the basis of their timing with regard to the noxious insult. **Acute emesis**, the most common variety, occurs within 2 h of treatment. **Delayed emesis** occurs 1–7 days after treatment; it is rare, but, when present, usually follows cisplatin administration. **Anticipatory emesis**, in which the administration of chemotherapy and represents a conditioned response to visual and olfactory stimuli previously associated with chemotherapy, occurs in patients who had emesis during previous treatment.\n\nAs with the analgesia ladder, emesis therapy should be tailored to the situation. For mildly and moderately emetogenic agents, prochlorperazine, 5–10 mg PO or 25 mg PR, is effective. Its efficacy may be enhanced by administering the drug before the chemotherapy is delivered. Dexamethasone, 10–20 mg IV, is also effective and may enhance the efficacy of prochlorperazine. For highly emetogenic agents such as cisplatin, methotrexate, mechlorethamine, dactinomycin, and streptozocin, combinations of agents work best and administration should begin 6–24 h before treatment. Ondansetron, 8 mg PO every 6 h the day before therapy and IV on the day of therapy, plus dexamethasone, 20 mg IV before treatment, is an effective regimen. Addition of oral aprepitant (a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist) to this regimen (125 mg on day 1, 80 mg on days 2 and 3) further decreases the risk of both acute and delayed vomiting. Like pain, emesis is easier to prevent than to alleviate.\n\nDelayed emesis may be related to bowel inflammation from the therapy and can be controlled with oral dexamethasone and oral metoclopramide, a dopamine receptor antagonist that also blocks serotonin receptors at high dosages. The best strategy for preventing anticipatory emesis is to control emesis in the early cycles of therapy to prevent the conditioning from taking place. If this is unsuccessful, prophylactic antiemetics the day before treatment may help. Experimental studies are evaluating behavioral modification.\n\n##### Depression\n\nThe recognition and treatment of depression are important components of management. The incidence of depression in cancer patients is ~25% overall and may be greater in patients with greater disability. This diagnosis is likely in a patient with a depressed mood (dysphoria) and/or a loss of interest in pleasure (anhedonia) for at least 2 weeks. In addition, three or more of the following symptoms are usually present: appetite change, sleep problems, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, inability to concentrate, and suicidal ideation. Patients with these symptoms should receive therapy. Medical therapy with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor such as fluoxetine (10–20 mg/d), sertraline (50–150 mg/d), or paroxetine (10–20 mg/d) or a tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline (50–100 mg/d) or desipramine (75–150 mg/d) should be tried, allowing 4–6 weeks for response. Effective therapy should be continued at least 6 months after resolution of symptoms. If therapy is unsuccessful, other classes of antidepressants may be used. In addition to medication, psychosocial interventions such as support groups, psychotherapy, and cognitive behavior therapy may be helpful.\n\n##### Fluids and Electrolytes\n\nFluid may accumulate acutely, most commonly as pleural, pericardial, or peritoneum. Asymptomatic malignant effusions may be observed. Prompt recognition of fluid issues is critical to avoid compression of vital structures.\n\n##### Effusions\n\nFluid may accumulate abnormally in the pleural cavity, pericardium, or peritoneum. Asymptomatic malignant effusions may not require treatment. Symptomatic effusions occurring in tumors responsive to systemic therapy usually do not require local treatment in patients with a life expectancy of at least 6 months.\n\nPleural effusions due to tumors may or may not contain malignant cells. Lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphomas account for ~75% of malignant pleural effusions. Their exudate nature is usually gauged by an effusion/serum protein ratio of ≥0.5 or effusion/serum lactate dehydrogenase ratio of ≥0.6. When the condition is symptomatic, thoracentesis is usually performed first. In most cases, symptomatic improvement occurs for <1 month. Chest tube drainage is required if symptoms recur within 2 weeks. Fluid is aspirated until the flow rate is <100 mL in 24 h. Then either 60 units of bleomycin or 1 g of doxycycline is infused into the chest tube in 50 mL of 5% dextrose in water; the tube is clamped; the patient is rotated on four sides, spending 15 min in each position; and, after 1–2 h, the tube is again attached to suction for another 24 h. The tube is then disconnected from suction and allowed to drain by gravity. If <100 mL drains over the next 24 h, the chest tube is pulled, and a radiograph is taken 24 h later. If the chest tube continues to drain fluid at an unacceptably high rate, sclerosis can be repeated. Bleomycin may be somewhat more effective than doxycycline but is very expensive. Doxycycline is usually the drug of first choice. If neither doxycycline nor bleomycin is effective, talc can be used.\n\nSymptomatic pericardial effusions are usually treated by creating a pericardial window or by stripping the pericardium. If the patient’s condition does not permit a surgical procedure, sclerosis can be attempted with doxycycline and/or bleomycin.\n\nMalignant ascites is usually treated with repeated paracentesis of small volumes of fluid. If the underlying malignancy is unresponsive to systemic therapy, peritoneovenous shunts may be inserted. Because of the risk of shunting tumor cells into the circulation, shunts are rarely used and carry significant complications. The major complications are infection and DIC. Malignant effusions of any site are best managed by treating the cancer.\n\n##### Nutrition\n\nCancer and its treatment may lead to a decrease in nutrient intake or sufficient magnitude to cause weight loss and alteration of intermediary metabolism. The prevalence of this problem is difficult to estimate because of variations in the definition of cancer cachexia, but most patients with advanced cancer experience weight loss and decreased appetite. A variety of both tumor-derived factors (e.g., bombesin, adrenocorticotropic hormone) and host-derived factors (e.g., tumor necrosis factor, interleukins 1 and 6, growth hormone) contribute to the altered metabolism, and a vicious cycle is established in which protein catabolism, glucose intolerance, and lipolysis cannot be reversed by the provision of calories.\n\nIt remains controversial how to assess nutritional status and when and how to intervene. Efforts to make the assessment objective have included the use of a prognostic nutritional index based on albumin levels, triceps skinfold thickness, transferrin levels, and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing. However, a simpler approach has been to define the threshold for nutritional intervention as <10% unexplained body weight loss, serum transferrin level <1500 mg/L (150 mg/dL), and serum albumin <34 g/L (3.4 g/dL).\n\nThe decision is important, because it appears that cancer therapy is substantially more toxic and less effective in the face of malnutrition. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether nutritional intervention can alter the natural history. Unless some pathology is affecting the absorptive function of the gastrointestinal tract, enteral nutrition provided orally or by the feeding is preferred over parenteral supplementation. However, the risks associated with the tube may outweigh the benefits. Megestrol acetate, a progestational agent, has been advocated as a pharmacologic intervention to improve nutritional status. Research in this area may provide more tools in the future as cytokine-mediated mechanisms are further elucidated.\n\n##### Psychosocial Support\n\nThe psychosocial needs of patients vary widely with their situation. Patients undergoing treatment must adjust to deforming surgery and loss of hair. Women who receive cosmetic advice that enables them to look better often feel better. Loss of control over how one spends time can contribute to the sense of vulnerability. Juggling the demands of work and family with the demands of treatment may create enormous stress. Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent and needs to be discussed openly with the patient. An empathetic health care team is sensitive to the individual patient’s needs and permits negotiation where such flexibility will not adversely affect the course of treatment.\n\nCancer survivors have other sets of difficulties. Patients may have fears associated with the termination of a treatment they associate with their continued survival. Adjustments are required to physical losses and handicaps, real and perceived. Patients may be preoccupied with minor physical problems. They perceive a decline in their job mobility and view themselves as less desirable workers. They may be victims of job and/or insurance discrimination. Patients may experience difficulty reentering their normal past life. They may feel guilty for having survived and may carry a sense of vulnerability to colds and other illnesses. Perhaps the most pervasive and threatening concern is the ever-present fear of relapse (the Damocles syndrome).\n\nPatients in whom therapy has been unsuccessful share other problems related to the end of life.\n\n##### Death and Dying\n\nThe most common causes of death in patients with cancer are infection (leading to circulatory failure), respiratory failure, hepatic failure, and renal failure. Intestinal blockage may lead to inanition and starvation. Central nervous system disease may lead to seizures, coma, and tentorial herniation. About 70% of patients develop syncope preterminally. However, many months usually pass between the diagnosis of cancer and the occurrence of these complications, and the goal for palliative therapy is the likelihood of the patient being able to live with disease; finally, as the disclosure of imminent death, another adjustment in treatment goals must be made. Patients rate the worst in preparation for the end of life and may go through stages of adjustment to the diagnosis. These include denial, isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance, and hope. Of course, patients do not all progress through the stages or proceed through them in the same order or at the same rate. Nevertheless, developing an understanding of how the patient has been affected by the diagnosis and is coping with it is an important goal of patient management.\n\nIt is best to speak frankly with the patient and family regarding the likely course of disease. These discussions can be difficult for the physician as well as for the patient and family. The critical features of the interaction are to reassure the patient and family that everything that can be done to provide comfort will be done. They will not be abandoned. Many patients prefer to be cared for in their homes or in a hospice setting rather than a hospital. The American College of Physicians has published a book called *Home Care Guide for Cancer: How to Care for Family and Friends at Home* that teaches an approach to successful problem-solving in home care. With appropriate planning, it should be possible to provide the patient with the necessary medical care as well as the psychological and spiritual support that will prevent the isolation and depersonalization that can attend in-hospital death.\n\nThe care of dying patients may take a toll on the physician. A “burnout” syndrome has been described that is characterized by fatigue, disengagement from patients and colleagues, and a loss of self-fulfillment. Efforts at stress reduction, maintenance of a balanced life, and setting realistic goals may combat this disorder.\n\n##### End-of-Life Decisions\n\nUnfortunately, a smooth transition in treatment goals from curative to palliative may not be possible in all cases because of the occurrence of serious treatment-related complications or rapid disease progression. Vigorous and invasive medical intervention in the face of a terminal illness is unlikely to be justified. However, if the reversibility of the condition is in doubt, the patient’s wishes determine the level of medical care. These wishes should be elicited before the terminal phase of illness and reviewed periodically. Information about advance directives can be obtained from the American Association of Retired Persons or other sources. Some states allow physicians to assist patients who choose to end their lives. This subject is challenging from an ethical and a medical point of view. Discussions of end-of-life decisions should be candid and involve clear informed consent, waiting periods, second opinions, and documentation.",
      "# Section 1. Neoplastic Disorders\n## 70. Prevention and Early Detection of Cancer\n### EDUCATION AND HEALTHFUL HABITS\nPublic education on the avoidance of identified risk factors for cancer and encouraging healthy habits contributes to cancer prevention. The clinician is a powerful messenger in this process. The patient-provider encounter provides an opportunity to teach patients about the hazards of smoking, influence of a healthy lifestyle and other exposures, and use of proven cancer screening methods.\n\n#### SMOKING CESSATION\n\nTobacco smoking is a strong, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer. Smokers have an ~1 in 3 lifetime probability of dying prematurely from a tobacco-related cancer, cardiovascular, or pulmonary disease. Tobacco use causes more deaths from cardiovascular disease than from cancer. Lung, laryngeal, and oral cancers are strongly linked to tobacco use, as are cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, bladder, kidney, uterine cervix, and acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\nThe number of cigarettes smoked per day and the level of inhalation of cigarette smoke are correlated with risk of lung cancer mortality. Light- and low-tar cigarettes are not safer because smokers tend to inhale them more frequently and deeply.\n\nThose who stop smoking have a 30–50% lower 10-year lung cancer mortality rate compared to those who continue smoking, despite the fact that some carcinogen-induced gene mutations persist for years after smoking cessation. Smoking cessation and avoidance would save more lives than any other public health activity.\n\nSecondhand smoke is carcinogenic and associated with a variety of respiratory illnesses in exposed children.\n\nTobacco use prevention is a pediatric issue. More than 80% of adult American smokers began before age 18. Although smoking rates have declined, ~8% of high school students reported smoking in the prior month, and use of electronic cigarettes is rising. Providers should query patients on tobacco use and offer smoking cessation support.\n\nCurrent approaches to smoking cessation recognize nicotine in tobacco as addictive (**Chap. 454**). The smoker who is quitting goes through stages including contemplation, action, and maintenance. Pharmacologic support can help reduce symptoms and improve cessation rates. Nicotine replacement and varenicline are effective. Counseling and behavioral support enhance success.\n\nSmokeless tobacco also poses substantial health risks, including dental caries, gingivitis, and cancers of the oral cavity. Systemic effects from absorption through mucosa may contribute to risks for other cancers.\n\n#### PHYSICAL ACTIVITY\n\nPhysical activity is associated with a decreased risk of colon and breast cancer. However, data are based on observational studies subject to confounding. Mechanisms include effects on insulin metabolism, inflammation, and immunity.\n\n#### DIET MODIFICATION\n\nInternational epidemiologic studies suggest that diets high in fat are associated with increased risks for cancers of the breast, colon, prostate, and endometrium. However, clinical trials have not confirmed benefits of low-fat diets. Studies suggest benefit from diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber.\n\nCalcium and vitamin D intake may reduce risks for some cancers, but results are inconsistent. Red meat and processed meats are linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer, though the effect size is small. Obesity itself is a risk factor for multiple cancers.\n\n#### ENERGY BALANCE\n\nHigher body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased cancer risk, especially for breast, colon, kidney, and esophageal cancers. A cohort study of >5 million adults showed a linear association between BMI and increased incidence of 17 cancers.\n\n#### SUN AVOIDANCE\n\nSkin cancers are linked to ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. Childhood and adolescent sunburns are particularly harmful. Sunscreens reduce risk of actinic keratoses, but not necessarily melanoma. Protective clothing and behavioral interventions (e.g., indoor tanning reduction) are key prevention strategies.\n\n#### CANCER CHEMOPREVENTION\n\nChemoprevention involves natural or synthetic substances to prevent or reverse carcinogenesis. Examples include hormonal agents, anti-inflammatory agents, or drugs that induce apoptosis or inhibit proliferation.\n\n##### TABLE 70-1.

Patients cured of squamous cell cancers of these sites are at high risk (~5% per year) of developing second cancers.\n\nPersistent oral HPV infection, especially HPV-16, increases the risk for oropharyngeal cancers, even in the absence of smoking or alcohol use. Oral HPV infection is believed to be largely sexually acquired. While the evidence is not definitive, HPV vaccination may reduce this risk.\n\nOral leukoplakia, a premalignant lesion, has been used as an intermediate marker in chemoprevention trials. Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) can cause regression of lesions, but high doses are not suitable for general use due to toxicity.\n\nSeveral large trials have tested chemoprevention for lung cancer. The ATBC trial in male smokers over 50 showed increased lung cancer incidence and mortality with β-carotene supplementation. CARET confirmed these findings and was terminated early due to harm. β-carotene is not recommended for lung cancer prevention.\n\n#### CHEMOPREVENTION OF BREAST CANCER\n\nTamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), reduces breast cancer risk by 49% over 5 years in high-risk women. However, it increases risk of endometrial cancer, stroke, and thromboembolism.\n\nRaloxifene has similar benefits for postmenopausal women, with fewer risks. The STAR trial found it was slightly less effective than tamoxifen but had fewer adverse effects.\n\nAromatase inhibitors (e.g., exemestane) reduce estrogen synthesis and are more effective than SERMs for high-risk postmenopausal women. A placebo-controlled trial showed a 65% reduction in invasive breast cancer incidence. Side effects include hot flashes, fatigue, and arthralgia.\n\n#### CHEMOPREVENTION OF PROSTATE CANCER\n\nFinasteride and dutasteride are 5-α-reductase inhibitors that block conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) showed a 25% reduction in cancer incidence over 7 years, but concerns remain over higher-grade tumors.\n\nMen treated with finasteride had fewer cancers (18.4%) than placebo (24.4%). However, the difference in high-grade tumors was not statistically significant in long-term follow-up."
